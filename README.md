HTB-Toolkit
===========




Welcome to my random collection of tools. After quite a bit of HTB action, I've decided having files living locally on several virtual machines is a bad idea. I'll start putting some of my research and wordlists into this repository to stay more organized.



See my other main repo [Penprep](https://github.com/Cashiuus/penprep) if you're interested in system setup scripts for all sorts of Linux software, as well as a bootstrap full setup of a Kali image specifically for HTB in that repo under `system-setup/kali/bootstrap-htb.sh`.
